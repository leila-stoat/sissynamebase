# The Sissy Name Database

A name conversion utility for TG/TF/CD/Sissy interactive fiction... and just for fun ;)

# What and Why

Among many interactive works of TG/CD/TF/Sissy fiction, I've seen different approaches to the usual problem of giving the player a new name after their transformation/demise. Such solutions (and a bit of commentary on each) include:

1. Fixed names, an elegant solution for a story with a set character/voice, but I'd rather give the player some input and allow for greater immersion;
2. Fixed options, among a selectoin of male/female/sissy/bimbo names, sometimes already paired (e.g. Brandon/Brandi, Marcus/Mary), a better solution than no choice, but still could be improved.
3. Let the player input both, which is the best for immersion and player choice, but, if I may nitpick(and I definitely *will*) it can make the story too much fabricated.

Ok, that last nitpick aside, all I aspire here is to have a system that can receive a male name(or female, even ;P) and return what name that perons will have after they're properly made into a bimbo, a sissy, a drag queen or a stripper.

...Yes, that means just applying the same algorithm to 4 different bases. But keeping them separate is part of the magic, after all not all sissy names are good stripper names and vice versa. ;)

# A 4 Step Plan

## Step 1: Informal Survey and Preparation

For now I'm just discussing idly about what makes a good name on each of those 4 categories (Bimbo, Sissy, Drag, Stripper) and preparing the groundwork for the next step, which means setting up a database and an input form for people to do their work.

## Step 2: Voluntary Data Collection and Curation

Here's where you, my darling, enter the fray! Through your voluntary work(which should be fun), you'll provide with as many names as you can think so we can populate the database!

I'll also do my part of the work with some initial data and curation, because obviously some names are not as good as others and, of course, I have to take in account trolls who'll enter sh\*t data, troll answers and, of course, Leila is not a sissy name, obviously! ;P 

## Step 3: The Algorithm

Here's the meat of the work and probably what I'll enjoy more! No big details here before I actually start the work, but it'll basically be a letter-by-letter decision tree that will take any input and come out with something else... or not! Maybe you do have a sissy bimbo name already, you just need to embrace your true nature! ;)

## Step 4: API and Tools

Finally, a bit more work and research in order to provide a way for other developers to take advantage of this algorithm into their own games!
